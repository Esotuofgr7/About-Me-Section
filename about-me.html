    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Jeremy Kachisikwu Esotu, a proud 13-year-old born on the 14th of April, 2012 in Sugarland, Houston, Texas, USA. I am the first child of Mr. and Mrs. Esotu, and the eldest brother to Jayden Tonna and Emmanuel Kauchechukwume Esotu. Family means everything to me—I’m surrounded by the love and support of my uncles, aunties, and cousins on both my paternal and maternal sides. Each relationship is a thread in the fabric of who I’m becoming.

      I am a happy Nigerian-American with dual citizenship, currently living in the western part of Nigeria. As a Nigerian Christian, I speak the vibrant Igbo language and am learning Yoruba and Hausa—a journey that connects me even deeper to my roots. My father taught me that our State of Origin is Anambara—known among Igbos by its indigenous name, just like Enugwu for Enugu State. I dream of making a name for myself through Codingal, the incredible teaching company that’s shaping young minds like mine. Torn between my love for science and art, I find both worlds too fascinating to let go of either. I believe I’m destined to become someone great—a superstar on TV, an innovator beyond just being an artist or a developer. I stand firmly for good over evil and peace over war, and I strive to live in a way that reflects those values every day.
